              <p>
                DSG LifeStyle is a fast-growing eyewear company based in New Delhi, redefining how India sees fashion and
                function. Founded with a vision to transform eyewear from a necessity into a fashion statement, we've
                quickly established ourselves as a brand that combines style, quality, and affordability.

                  <p>
                    Led by our founder and CEO Sumit Gupta, along with co-founder Ankita Kataky and CMO Anuj Singh, our

                    experiences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their vision was simple yet ambitious: to create eyewear that serves as both a functional necessity
                    and a fashion statement, accessible to all Indians regardless of where they live.
